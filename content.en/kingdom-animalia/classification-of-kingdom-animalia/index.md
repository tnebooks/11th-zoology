Classification of Kingdom Animalia## Classification of Kingdom Animalia


Animal kingdom is divided into two sub-kingdoms, the Parazoa and Eumetazoa based on their organisation. **1\. Parazoa: These include the** multicellular sponges and their cells are loosely aggregated and do not form tissues or organs. **2\. Eumetazoa: These include multicellular** animals with well defined tissues, which are organised as organs and organ systems. Eumetazoans includes two taxonomic levels called grades. They include Radiata and **Bilateria**.

**Grade 1: Radiata**

Among the eumetazoa, a few animals have an organisation of two layers of cells, the outer ectoderm and inner endoderm, separated by a jelly like mesoglea. They are radially symmetrical and are diploblastic. Examples: Cnidarians (sea anemone, jelly fish) and Ctenophores (comb jellies).

**Grade 2: Bilateria**

The eumetazoans other than Radiata, show organ level of organisation and are bilaterally symmetrical and triploblastic. The grade Bilateria includes two taxonomic levels called **Division.**

**Division 1: Protostomia (_Proto_: first; _stomium_: mouth)**

Protostomia includes the eumetazoans in which the embryonic blastopore develops into mouth. This division includes three subdivisions namely **acoelomata, pseudocoelomata and schizocoelomata.**

**Division 2: Deuterostomia (_deuteron_: secondary; _stomium_: mouth)**

Eumetazoans in which anus is formed from or near the blastopore and the mouth is formed away from the blastopore. It includes only one subdivision **Enterocoelomata.** They have a true coelom called enterocoel, formed from the archenteron.
