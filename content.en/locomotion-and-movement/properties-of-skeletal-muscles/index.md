Properties of Skeletal Muscles## Properties of Skeletal Muscles


The four major properties of skeletal muscles are **Excitability/Irritability**—The ability to respond or contract in response to chemical and electrical signals. **Contractility**—The ability to shorten which causes movement of the structures to which the muscles are attached. **Conductivity** —Stimulus acting on one region of muscle fibre spreads to all parts of the muscle is known as conductivity.




  

**Elasticity/Distensibility**—The ability to return to the original resting length after a muscle has been stretched.
