Types of muscles## Types of muscles
 Muscles are specialized tissues which are derived from the embryonic **mesoderm**. They are made of cells called **myocytes** and constitute 40 â€“ 50 percent of body weight in an adult. These cells are bound together by a connective tissue to form a muscular tissue. The muscles are classified into three types, namely **skeletal, visceral** and **cardiac muscles.**
