Types of movement## Types of movement
 The different types of movements that occur in the cells of our body are amoeboid, ciliary, flagellar and muscular movement.

**Amoeboid movement -** Cells such as macrophages exhibit amoeboid movement for engulfing pathogens by pseudopodia formed by the streaming movement of the cytoplasm.

**Ciliary movement -** This type of movement occurs in the respiratory passages and genital tracts which are lined by ciliated epithelial cells.

**Flagellar movement -** This type of movement occurs in the cells which are having flagella or whip-like motile organelle. The sperm cells show flagellar movement.

**Muscular movement -**The movement of hands, legs, jaws, tongue are caused by the contraction and relaxation of the muscle which is termed as the muscular movement.
