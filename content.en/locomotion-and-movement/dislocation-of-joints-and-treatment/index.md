## Dislocation of joints and treatment


Dislocation of joint is the total displacement of the articular end of the bone from the joint cavity. The normal alignment of the bones becomes altered. Joints of the jaw, shoulders, fingers and thumbs are most commonly dislocated.

Dislocations of joints are classified as (i) Congenital deformities (ii) Traumatic (iii) Pathological and (iv)Paralytic.

 **(i) Congenital deformities** are due to genetic factors or factors operating on the developing foetus.

**(ii) Traumatic dislocation** is due to serious violence. It occurs in the shoulder, elbow and hip.

**(iii) Pathological dislocation** is caused by some diseases like tuberculosis. It may cause dislocation of the hip.

**(iv) Paralytic dislocation** caused by paralysis of one group of muscles of an extremity.

**Treatment** 
If the joint doesn't return to normal condition naturally the following treatments should be given.

• Manipulation or repositioning
• Immobilization 
• Medication
• Rehabilitation
