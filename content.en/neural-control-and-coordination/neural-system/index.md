Neural System## Neural System
 The neural system comprises of highly specialized cells called **neurons**, which can detect, receive, process and transmit different kinds of stimuli. Simple form of neural system as nerve net is seen in lower invertebrates. The neural system of higher animals are well developed and performs the following basic functions:

**• Sensory functions**\- It receives sensory input from internal and external environment.

**• Motor functions**\- It transmits motor commands from the brain to the skeletal and muscular system.

**• Autonomic functions**\- Reflex actions.
