Human Neural System## Human Neural System
 The human neural system is divided into two**, the central neural system (CNS)** and **the peripheral neural system** (**PNS**). The structural and functional units of the neural system are neurons that transmit nerve impulses. The non-nervous special cells called **neuroglia** form the supporting cells of the nervous tissue.  

There are three functional classes of neurons. They are the **afferent neurons** that take sensory impulses to the Central Neural system (CNS) from the sensory organs; the **efferent neurons** that carry motor impulses from the CNS to the effector organs; and **interneurons** that lie entirely within the CNS between the afferent and efferent neurons.

The central neural system lacks connective tissue, so the interneuron space is filled by neuroglia. They perform several functions such as providing nourishment to the surrounding neurons; involving the memory process; repairing the injured tissues due to their dividing and regenerating capacity; and acting as phagocyte cells to engulf the foreign particles at the time of any injury to the brain.

Glial cells do not lose the ability to undergo cell division; so most brain tumours of neural origin consists of glial cells. Neurons themselves do not form tumours because they are unable to divide and multiply.
