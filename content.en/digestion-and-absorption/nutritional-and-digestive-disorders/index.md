Nutritional and digestive disorders## Nutritional and digestive disorders


Intestinal tract is more prone to bacterial, viral and parasitic worm infections. This infection may cause inflammation of the inner lining of colon called colitis. The most common symptoms of colitis are rectal bleeding, abdominal cramps, and diarrhoea.

**Protein energy malnutrition: (PEM)** Growing children require more amount of protein for their growth and development. Protein deficient diet during early stage of children may lead to protein energy malnutrition such as **Marasmus and Kwashiorkor**. Symptoms are dry skin, pot-belly, oedema in the legs and face, stunted growth, changes in hair colour, weakness and irritability. Marasmus is an acute form of protein malnutrition. This condition is due to a diet with inadequate carbohydrate and protein. Such children are suffer from diarrhoea, body becomes lean and weak (emaciated) with reduced fat and muscle tissue with thin and folded skin. **Indigestion:** It is a digestive disorder in which the food is not properly digested leading to a feeling  

of fullness of stomach. It may be due to inadequate enzyme secretion, anxiety, food poisoning, over eating, and spicy food.

**Constipation:** In this condition, the faeces are retained within the rectum because of irregular bowel movement due to poor intake of fibre in the diet and lack of physical activities.

**Vomiting:** It is reverse peristalsis. Harmful substances and contaminated food from stomach are ejected through the mouth. This action is controlled by the vomit centre located in the medulla oblongata. A feeling of nausea precedes vomiting.

**Jaundice:** It is the condition in which liver is affected and the defective liver fails to break down haemoglobin and to remove bile pigments from the blood. Deposition of these pigments changes the colour of eye and skin yellow. Sometimes, jaundice is caused due to hepatitis viral infections.

**Liver Cirrhosis:** Chronic disease of liver results in degeneration and destruction of liver cells resulting in abnormal blood vessel and bile duct leading to the formation of fibrosis. It is also called deserted liver or scarred liver. It is caused due to infection, consumption of poison, malnutrition and alcoholism.

**Gall Stones:** Any alteration in the composition of the bile can cause the formation of stones in the gall bladder. The stones are mostly formed of crystallized cholesterol in the bile. The gall stone causes obstruction in the cystic duct, hepatic duct and also hepato- pancreatic duct causing pain, jaundice and pancreatitis.




  

**Appendicitis:** It is the inflammation of the vermiform appendix, leading to severe abdominal pain. The treatment involves the removal of appendix by surgery. If treatment is delayed the appendix may rupture and results in infection of the abdomen, called **peritonitis**. **Hiatus Hernia (Diaphragmatic Hernia):** It is a structural abnormality in which superior part of the stomach protrudes slightly above the diaphragm. The exact cause of hiatus hernias is not known. In some people, injury or other damage may weaken muscle tissue, by applying too much pressure (repeatedly) on the muscles around the stomach while coughing, vomiting, and straining during bowel movement and lifting heavy object. Heart burn is also common in those with a hiatus hernia. In this condition, stomach contents travel back into the oesophagus or even into oral cavity and causes pain in the centre of the chest due to the eroding nature of acidity (Figure.5.10).

**Diarrhoea:** It is the most common gastrointestinal disorder worldwide. It is sometimes caused by bacteria or viral infections through food or water. When the colon is infected, the  

lining of the intestine is damaged by the pathogens, thereby the colon is unable to absorb fluid. The abnormal frequency of bowel movement and increased liquidity of the faecal discharge is known as diarrhoea. Unless the condition is treated, dehydration can occur. Treatment is known as **oral hydration therapy. This involves drinking** plenty of fluids – sipping small amounts of water at a time to rehydrate the body. **Peptic Ulcer:** It refers to an eroded area of the tissue lining (mucosa) in the stomach or duodenum. Duodenal ulcer occurs in people in the age group of 25 - 45 years. Gastric ulcer is more common in persons above the age of 50 years. Ulcer is mostly due to infections caused by the bacterium **_Helicobacter pylori_.** It may also be caused due to uncontrolled usage of aspirin or certain antiinflammatory drugs. Ulcer may also be caused due to smoking, alcohol, caffeine and psychological stress.

Nobel Prize for the year 2005 was awarded to Robin Warren and Barry Marshall for the discovery of _Helicobacter pylori_ which causes peptic ulcer**.**

**Obesity:** It is caused due to the storage of excess of body fat in adipose tissue. It may induce hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease and diabetes. Obesity may be genetic or due to excess intake of food, endocrine and metabolic disorders. Degree of obesity is assessed by body mass index (**BMI**). A normal BMI range for adult is 19-25 above 25 is considered as obese. BMI is calculated as body weight in Kg, divided by the square of body height in meters. For example, a 50 Kg person with a height of 160 cms would have a BMI of 19.5.

That is BMI = 50 /(1.6)2= 19.5




  

Do you know? The oesophagus takes your chewed food and squeezes it downward using muscle contractions called peristalsis.

Do you know? The liver is also an important detoxication organ. It helps to lter and elimate harmful toxins from our body.

Do you know? Small intestine is lined with mucosa, a layer of tissue that helps to absorb nutrients, produce digestive enzymes, and make mucus to protect the delicate intestinal wall.

Gall bladder stores bile secretion.

Digestive sy disorders are diarrhoea, co and acid re obesity, etc.

Oesophagus:

The oesophagus is a tube connecting the mouth to the stomach. After swallow, the food travels down through the esophagus to the stomach.

Liver:

The liver secrete bile. Bile helps the small intestine by breaking downs fats and making them easier to absorb.

Small intestine:

Most of the nutrients form food are digested and absorbed in the small intestine.

Large intestine (Colon):

Most of the bacteria living in the digestive tract can be found in the large intestine. This is where the digestive process comes to an end.

Do you know?

The human digestive is pretty amazing. Turn into fuel the body uses for e grow. However sometimes our everyday routine can ge healthy digestion.

There are more then

100 trillion bacterial cells in your body.

The digestive tract is home to a natural balance of good, bad, and neutral bacteria.

Do you know? Good bacteria, also called probiotics, support overall digestive and immune health.

Protease Helps digest protein

Lipase Helps digest fats

Amylase Helps digest carbohydrates

Mouth:

Three pairs of salivary glands secrets saliva. Enzymes in the saliva mix with food particles and start breaking them down while chewing.

Cardiac sphincter:

The Cardiac sphincter is where the oesophagus meets the stomach. This group of muscles acts like a gate to prevent stomach acid from going back up (reuxing) into the oesophagus.

Stomach:

Gastric juice contain HCl and gastric enzymes.

Hydrochloric acid (HCl) helps to digest proteins and other foods by pepsin enzymes while minimizing harmful bacteria.

Pancreas

The pancreas is connected to the duodenum where three important digestive enzmyes are made:

Up to 70% of our natural immune system support is in the digestive tract.

**Summary**
 The digestive system of human consists

of the mouth (oral cavity), pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus. The accessory digestive glands include the salivary glands, the liver (with gall bladder) and the pancreas. The process of digestion involves intake of the food (Ingestion), breakdown of the food into micromolecules (Digestion), absorption of these molecules into the blood stream (Absorption), the absorbed substances becoming components of cells (Assimilation) and elimination of the undigested substances (Egestion).

Food comprises of macronutrients and micronutrients. The nutrients required in larger quantities are called macronutrients,

Macronutrients are lipids, carbohydrates, proteins and the micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. Water plays an important role in the metabolic processes and prevents dehydration of the body.

Intestinal tract is more prone to bacterial, viral and parasitic worm infections. Such infection, called colitis, may couse inflammation of the inner lining of the colon. Growing children require more protein for their growth and development. Protein deficient diet during early stage of children may lead to protein energy malnutrition such as Marasmus and Kwashiorkor.
