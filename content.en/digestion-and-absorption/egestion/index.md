# Egestion


The digestive waste and unabsorbed substances in the ileum enter into the large intestine and it mostly contains fibre called roughage. The roughage is utilized by symbiotic bacteria in the large intestine for the production of substances like vitamin K and other metabolites. All these substances are absorbed in the colon along with water. The waste is then solidified into faecal matter in the rectum. The faecal matter initiates a neural reflex causing an urge or desire for its removal. The egestion of faeces through the anal opening is called defaecation. It is a voluntary process and is carried out by a peristaltic movement.
