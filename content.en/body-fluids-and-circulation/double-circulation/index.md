Double Circulation## Double Circulation
 Circulation of the blood was first described by **William Harvey** (1628). There are two types of blood circulation in vertebrates, **single circulation** and **double circulation** which is shown in Figure 7.10 (a and b) and 7.11.

The complete double blood circulation is more prominent in mammals because of the complete partition of all the chambers (Auricles and ventricles) in the heart.

In systemic circulation, the oxygenated blood entering the aorta from the left ventricle is carried by a network of arteries,

arterioles and capillaries to the tissues. The deoxygenated blood from the tissue is collected by venules, veins and vena cava and emptied into the right atrium. In pulmonary circulation, the blood from heart (right ventricle) is taken to the lungs by pulmonary artery and the oxygenated blood from the lungs is emptied into the left auricle by the pulmonary vein.

Completely separated circuits have an important advantage. Different pressures are maintained in the pulmonary and systemic circulation. Why is this advantageous? In the lungs the capillaries must be very thin to allow gas exchange, but if the blood flows through these thin capillaries under high pressure the fluid can leak through or ruptures the capillary walls and can accumulate in the tissues. This increases the diffusion distance and reduces the efficiency of the gas exchange. In contrast high pressure is required to force blood through the long systemic circuits. Hence the arteries close to the heart have increased pressure than the arteries

away from the heart. Completely separated circuits (pulmonary and systemic) allow these two different demands to be met with.

**7\. 6 Regulation of Cardiac Activity**

The type of heart in human is myogenic because the heart beat originates from the muscles of the heart. The nervous and endocrine systems work together with paracrine signals (metabolic activity) to influence the diameter of the arterioles and alter the blood flow. The neuronal control is achieved through autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic). Sympathetic neurons release **nor- epinephrine** and adrenal medulla releases **epinephrine. The two hormones bind to β –** adrenergic receptors and increase the heart rate. The parasympathetic neurons secrete acetylcholine that binds to **muscarinic receptors** and decreases the heart beat. **Vasopressin** and **angiotensin II**, involved in the regulation of the kidneys, results in vasoconstriction while **natriuretic peptide** promotes vasodilation. Vagus nerve is a parasympathetic nerve that supplies the atrium especially the SA and the AV nodes.
