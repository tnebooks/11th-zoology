Diagnosis and Treatment## Diagnosis and Treatment


**Angiogram** Angiogram is a procedure that uses a special dye and X-ray to see how blood flows through the coronary arteries of the heart and it can be used to detect abnormality in the blood vessels through out the body.

**Angioplasty** Angioplasty is the stretching of an artery that is narrowed due to atherosclerosis. The risk involved in this procedure is minimal. During an angioplasty a small long balloon catheter is threaded through the blocked artery. A deflated balloon is attached to the catheter and the balloon is inflated to widen the arterial wall. Then the tube and the balloon are removed. A small metal scaffold called  

stent is left in place. This scaffolding keeps the blood vessel open and allows free flow of blood. Slow releasing stents are now available that can release chemicals to prevent further block of the artery.

**Varicose veins** The veins are so dilated that the valves prevent back flow of blood. The veins lose their elasticity and become congested. Common sites are legs, rectal-anal regions (haemorrhoids), the oesophagus and the spermatic cord. **Embolism** is the obstruction of the blood vessel by abnormal mass of materials such as fragment of the blood clot, bone fragment or an air bubble. Embolus may lodge in the lungs, coronary artery or liver and leads to death. **Aneurysm** The weakened regions of the wall of the artery or veins bulges to form a balloon like sac. Unruptured aneurysm may exert pressure on the adjacent tissues or may burst causing massive haemorrhage.

**Bypass Surgery** When the arteries that bring blood to the heart muscles (coronary artery) are blocked by **plaque** (accumulation of fat, cholesterol and other substances) the person is advised to undergo Bypass surgery. After the surgery the blood flow to coronary artery is increased and the person is relieved from chest pain. This is a major surgery where damaged blood vessel is replaced by the healthy one taken from different part of the body. Mostly it is taken from legs. During this surgery patients blood system is connected with a pump oxygenator (heart lung machine). After the




  

completion of the surgery the blood vessel is connected to normal the circulation and the blood flows freely.

**Heart Transplantation** A heart transplant is a surgical transplantation procedure which is done to replace a diseased or a damaged heart. This procedure is performed on a patient with end stage heart failure or severe coronary artery disease, when other medical ailments or surgical treatments have failed. The most common procedure is to take a functioning heart from a brain dead person (organ donor) and is transplanted in a person with a damaged heart. After the heart transplant the average life span of the person increases.

**Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)** In 1956, **James Elam** and **Peter Safar** were the first to use **mouth to mouth resuscitation**. CPR is a life saving procedure that is done at the time of emergency conditions such as when a person’s breath or heart beat has stopped abruptly in case of drowning, electric shock or heart attack. CPR includes rescue of breath, which is achieved by mouth to mouth breathing, to deliver oxygen to the victim’s lungs by external chest compressions which helps to circulate blood to the vital organs. CPR  

must be performed within 4 to 6 minutes after cessation of breath to prevent brain damage or death. Along with CPR, defibrillation is also done. Defibrillation means a brief electric shock is given to the heart to recover the function of the heart.

Each year over several million people worldwide die of heart disease, than from other conditions. For some patients heart transplant is the only hope. Raju was 62 years old when muscles of both the ventricles had deteriorated. He was lucky enough because biomedical engineers were able develop a pumping device called **‘total artificial heart’**. Raju’s heart was completely removed and an artificial heart was put in place. He was able to go home within a few weeks. This artificial heart would have kept him in alive until suitable real heart was available for transplant.

First heart transplantation was performed in the year 1959. Human

heart transplant was performed by Prof. Christian Bernard in South Africa in the year 1967, December 3 at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. Dr Anangipalli Venugopal was the first to perform heart transplant at AIIMS, India on August 3, 1994.









  

**Summary**
 Vertebrates circulate blood in their body, to transport essential substances to the cells and to carry waste substances from them. Blood is carried away from the heart, passes through tissues in capillaries and is returned to the heart in veins. Blood pressure drops gradually as it passes along this system. Arteries have thick, elastic walls which allow them to withstand high blood pressure. Arterioles are small arteries that help to reduce blood pressure and control the amount of blood flow to different tissues. Capillaries are only just wide enough to allow the passage of red blood cells, and have very thin wall to allow efficient and rapid transfer of materials between blood and cells. Veins have thinner walls than arteries and possess valves that allow blood to flow back to the heart even at low pressure.

Blood consist of plasma and formed elements. Blood plasma leaks from capillaries to form tissue fluid. This is collected into lymphatics as lymph, and returned to the blood in the subclavian veins. Tissue fluid and lymph are almost identical in composition. They contain fewer plasma protein molecules than blood plasma as these proteins are too large to pass through the pores in the capillary walls. The formed elements of blood constitute RBC, WBC and Platelets.

The mammalian heart has four chambers, right and left artia and right and left ventricles. The separation of chambers in the heart results in complete double circulation. The cardiac cycle is a continuous process but can be considered in five stages. Beating of the heart is initiated by the sinoatrial node (SAN) or pacemaker which has its own myogenic rhythm. Blood  

pressure is the force exerted by blood on the walls of blood vessels, and it is responsible for moving blood through the vessels.

Cardiovascular disease accounts for more deaths each year in the India. Cardiovascular conditions include systemic hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and stroke. Cardiovascular diagnostic techniques and treatments include cardiac angiography, balloon angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass. The circulatory system contributes to homeostasis by transporting O2, CO2, wastes, electrolytes, and hormones from one part of the body to another.
