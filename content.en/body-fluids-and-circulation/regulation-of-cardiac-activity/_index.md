# Regulation of Cardiac Activity

The type of heart in human is myogenic because the heart beat originates from the muscles of the heart. The nervous and endocrine systems work together with paracrine signals (metabolic activity) to influence the diameter of the arterioles and alter the blood flow. The neuronal control is achieved through autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic). Sympathetic neurons release **nor- epinephrine** and adrenal medulla releases **epinephrine. The two hormones bind to β –** adrenergic receptors and increase the heart rate. The parasympathetic neurons secrete acetylcholine that binds to **muscarinic receptors** and decreases the heart beat. **Vasopressin** and **angiotensin II**, involved in the regulation of the kidneys, results in vasoconstriction while **natriuretic peptide** promotes vasodilation. Vagus nerve is a parasympathetic nerve that supplies the atrium especially the SA and the AV nodes.
