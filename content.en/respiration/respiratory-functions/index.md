# Respiratory functions
 The five primary functions of the respiratory system are â€“

i. To exchange O2 and CO2 between the atmosphere and the blood.

ii. To maintain homeostatic regulation of body pH.

iii. To protect us from inhaled pathogens and pollutants.

iv. To maintain the vocal cords for normal communication (vocalization).

v. To remove the heat produced during cellular respiration.
