Regulation of Respiration## Regulation of Respiration
 A specialised respiratory centre present in the medulla oblongata of the hind brain called **respiratory rhythm centre** is responsible for this regulation. **Pneumotaxic centre** present in pons varoli region of the brain moderates the function




  

of the respiratory rhythm centre to ensure normal breathing. The chemosensitive area found close to the rhythm centre is highly sensitive to CO2 and H+. And H+ are eliminated out by respiratory process. Receptors associated with the aortic arch and carotid artery send necessary signals to the rhythm centre for remedial action. The role of O2 is insignificant in the regulation of respiratory rhythm.

**Particulate matter PM** 2.5 in the air is increasing day by day which causes respiratory illness. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reports that the quality of air is not good due to soot and smoke. So some cities in India are using CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) as fuel.
