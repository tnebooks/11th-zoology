# Concept of species

Species is the basic unit of classification. The term species was coined by **John Ray**, and in his book **“Historia Generalis Plantarum”** (3 volumes) in 1693 described species as a group of morphologically similar organisms arising from a common ancestor. Carolus Linnaeus in his book **“Systema naturae”** considered species as the basic unit of classification. Species can be defined as a group of organisms that have similar morphology and physiology and can interbreed to produce fertile offsprings. In 1859 Charles Darwin in his book **Origin of species** explains the evolutionary connection of species by the process of natural selection.
