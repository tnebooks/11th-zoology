## Tools for study of taxonomy
Tools and taxonomical aids may be different for the study of plants and animals. Herbarium and Botanical garden may be used as tools for the study of plant taxonomy. In the case of animal studies, the classical tools are Museum, Taxonomical Keys and Zoological and Marine parks.

The important components of the taxonomical tools are field visits, survey, identification, classification, preservation and documentation. Many tools are being used for taxonomical studies, amongst them some of the important tools are discussed below:

### The classical taxonomical tools 

**Taxonomical Keys:** Keys are based on comparative analysis of the similarities and dissimilarities of organisms. There are separate keys for different taxonomic categories. 

**Museum:** Biological museums have collection of preserved plants and animals for study and ready reference. Specimens of both extinct and living organisms can be studied. 

**Zoological parks:** These are places where wild animals are kept in protected environments under human care. It enables us to study their food habits and behaviour. 

**Marine parks:** Marine organisms are maintained in protected enviroments. **Printed taxonomical tools** consist of identification cards, description, field guides and manuals.
