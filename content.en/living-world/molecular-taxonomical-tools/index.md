Molecular taxonomical tools## Molecular taxonomical tools

Technological advancement has helped to evolve molecular taxonomical tools from classical tools to molecular tools. The accuracy and authenticity is more significant in the molecular tools. The following methods are being used for taxonomical classification. 

Molecular techniques and approaches such as DNA barcoding (short genetic marker in an organism’s DNA to identify it as belonging to a particular species), DNA hybridization (measures the degree of genetic similarity between pools of DNA sequences), DNA fingerprinting (to identify an individual from a sample of DNA by looking at unique patterns in their DNA), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP) analysis (difference in homologous DNA sequences that can be detected by the presence of fragments of different lengths after digestion of the DNA samples), and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) sequencing ( to amplify a specific gene, or portion of gene,) are used as taxonomical tools

**Automated species identification tools**
It consists of Cyber tools. For example:
ALIS, DAISY, ABIS, SPIDA, Draw wing, etc.
ALIS ----> Automated Leafhopper Identification System.
DAISY ----> Digital Automated Identification System.
ABIS  ----->Automatic Bee
Identification System.
SPIDA ------> Species Identified
Automatically (spiders, wasp
and bee wing ­characters).
Draw wing ----> Honey bee wing identification.

**Neo taxonomical tools** – This is based on Electron Microscopy images to study the molecular structures of cell organelles.
**Ethology of taxonomical tools** – Based on the behaviour of the organisms it can be classified. For example sound of birds, bioluminescence, etc.
**e-Taxonomic resources** – INOTAXA is an electronic resource for digital images and description about the species which was developed by Natural History Museum, London. INOTAXA means Integrated­Open TAXonomic Access.
