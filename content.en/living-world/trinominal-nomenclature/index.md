Trinominal nomenclature## Trinominal nomenclature
*(Tri – three)*
This naming system was proposed by Huxley and Stricklandt, Trinomen means, three names: generic name, species name and sub-species name. When members of any species which have large variations then trinomial system is used. On the basis of dissimilarities, this species gets classified into subspecies. It is the extension of binominal nomenclature system which has an addition of subspecies. All the three names are set in italics and only the first letter of generic name is capitalized, if handwritten then it should be underlined separately E.g.Corvus splendens splendens (Indian house crow) Tautonymy: The practice of naming the animals in which the generic name and species name are the same, is called Tautonymy. e.g. Naja naja (The Indian Cobra).

### Rules of Nomenclature
- The scientific name should be italicized
in printed form and if handwritten, it
should be underlined separately.
- The generic name’s (Genus) first
alphabet should be in uppercase.
- The specific name (species) should be
in lowercase.
- The scientific names of any two
- organisms are not similar.
The name or abbreviated name of
the scientist who first publishes the
scientific name may be written after
the species name along with the year of
publication. For example Lion-Felis leo
Linn., 1758 or Felis leo L., 1758.
- If the species name is framed after any
person’s name the name of the species
shall end with i, ii or ae.

For example, a new species of a ground- dwelling lizard (Cyrtodactylus) has been discovered and named after Scientist Varad Giri, Cyrtodactylus varadgirii.
