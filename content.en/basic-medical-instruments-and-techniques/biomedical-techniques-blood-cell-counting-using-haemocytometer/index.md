Biomedical Techniques Blood Cell Counting using Haemocytometer## Biomedical Techniques Blood Cell Counting using Haemocytometer


The haemocytometer is a thick glass slide with a counting chamber in the middle. The counting chamber contains two grids with improved Neubaur rulings of 3 by 3 mm primary square. The primary square is further subdivide into 9 secondary squares, each 1 by 1 mm. The four corner squares are used for the white blood cell count which are further subdivided into 16 tertiary squares. The central secondary square is divided into 25 tertiary squares, each of which measure 0.2 by 0.2 mm, each single tertiary square is further divided into 16 smaller squares. The five black squares along with the shaded squares in the centre are used for platelet count, while the five black squares alone are used for red blood cells counting (Figure12.10).

**Diluting fluid**

The blood cells are diluted in specific diluting fluid to keep the cells intact. RBC diluting

fluid (Hayem’s) is isotonic with blood, hence haemolysis does not occur. The blood is diluted 1:200 times with RBC diluting fluid and the cells are counted under 45X objective of the microscope.

The diluting fluid used for WBC count is Turk’s solution which contains glacial acetic acid and Gentian violet. The glacial acetic acid lyses the red blood cells and the Gentian violet stains the nuclei of the leucocytes. The blood is diluted 1:20 times and the cell are counted under 10X objective of the microscope. The total number of cells counted is expressed in mm3.

**Blood cell counting using hemocytometer**

1\. The blood is collected till the 0.5 graduation in the pipette.

2\. The diluting fluid is taken till the graduations 11 and 101 of the WBC and RBC pipette respectively.

3\. The blood is diluted and mixed well with the respective diluting fluid by rotating the pipette horizontally several times.

4\. The cover slip is placed on top of the counting chamber.

5\. The tip of the pipette is placed on the counting chamber and fluid discharged till it fills the chambers.

6\. The cells are allowed to settle for several minutes and the ruled area is viewed under the microscope.

**Preparation of Blood Smear** The examination of peripheral dry blood smear is a very important laboratory test as it is possible to

• Estimate approximately the number of cellular components

• Study the morphology of these components

• Observe the presence of blood parasites

• Study the response of the body to various diseases

The methodology for the preparation of blood smear is as follows (Figure12.11)

1\. Place a drop of blood on a clean glass slide about 1cm from one end

2\. Using another glass slide placed at an angle of about 45o to the previous slide.

3\. Spread the drop of blood quickly in one stroke as a thin film

4\. Stain the film using Leishman’s stain 5. Allow the slide to dry and wash the

excess stain 6. Observe the slide under a light

microscope (Figure12.12).

A person suffering from severe fever, head ach and fatigue so he visits his doctor. What type of diagnosing procedure does the doctor recommended for him. Name the medical equipment is used for it?  

1\. Place a small drop of whole on a very clean slide. Hold a second slide at the angle shown.

3\. Maintain firm contact with the bottom slide and push the top slide in one motion to produce the smear.

2\. While maintaining contact with the bottom slide, pull the top slide back to contact the drop, which will spread by the capillary action.

**Differential Count**

The differential WBC count is the method in which the numbers of different types of white blood cells present in the blood are counted by examining a well stained peripheral blood smear (prepared by the above method). The number of each type of white blood cell is then expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells counted (Figure12.13).

**Summary**
 Medical instruments help in correct diagnosis and treatment to observing patients, examining organs, making measurements and administering medication. Today’s medical instruments are considerably more complicated and diverse, primarily because they incorporate electronic systems for sensing, transducing, manipulating, storing, and displaying data or information. The modern electronic stethoscope is a high precision instrument used to hear with clarity the internal sounds of the human body even in a noisy environment or through the heavy clothing of the patient. The sphygmomanometer is a device to diagnose pathological conditions such as hypertension and hypotension. A glucometer is a simple and portable medical device used to find out the approximate levels of blood glucose. Autoanalyser is a computer controlled device and used to quick estimation of various bio-chemical substances like glucose, urea, cholesterol, enzymes and other proteins present in body fluids.

Imaging instruments produce diagnostic images and help in the detection of the diseases or defects in an organ at a very early stage, when there are no clinical  

manifestations or the disease is undetected by the conventional methods of investigations. Then proper therapeutic or surgical measures can be adopted. An EEG is a test to evaluate the electrical activities of the brain. X-Rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation to visualize the internal structures of a patient. Ultrasound waves are used to image the foetus at different stages of pregnancy used to hear foetal heart sound, blood flow, diagnose the damages in heart and diagnosis of tumours, gall stones, kidney stones, and obstructions in the genital tracts.
