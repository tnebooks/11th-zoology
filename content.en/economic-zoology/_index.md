Chapter 13UNIT V

Zoology is a branch of science which deals with the study of animals. For someone who is interested in pursuing a career in Zoology, there are several specializations that the students can venture into. There are physiologists, who study the metabolic processes of animals; there are taxonomists who deal with the naming and the classification of animal species; embryologist whose job is to study and focus

This field is concerned with the preservation and management of animal kingdom and a career in it would mean that you are a part of that responsibility. A zoologist might even get to travel because the nature of his/ her job. Channels like National Geographic, Animal Planet, and Discovery Channel are in constant need of Zoologists for research and documentaries. Zoologists are also hired for zoos, wildlife services, botanical gardens, conservation organizations, national parks, nature reserves, universities, laboratories, aquariums, animal clinics, fisheries and aquaculture, museums, research, pharmaceutical companies, veterinary hospitals, etc.

farm animals possess great economic value. Since prehistoric time human beings taken maximum advantage from animals by keeping them under their control through domestication. The economic success of the industries, based on animals and their products, depends on the proper production, management and development of the next generation of farm animals.

## Scope of Zoology
 Studying Zoology can provide self employment opportunities and you can become an entrepreneur. Economic Zoology is a branch of science that deals with economically useful animals. It involves the study of application of animals for human welfare. The need of Zoology is not just to improve our economic condition but also to provide food security and provide employment opportunities. Based on the economic importance, animals can be categorized as: 1. Animals for food and food products 2. Economically beneficial animals 3. Animals of aesthetic importance 4. Animals for scientific research

## Vermiculture Vermiculture
 is the process of using earthworms to decompose organic food waste, into a nutrient-rich material capable of supplying necessary nutrients which helps to sustain plant growth. The aim is to continually increase the number of worms to have a sustainable harvest. The excess worms can either be used to expand a vermicomposting operation or sold to customers. Vermicompost is the primary goal of vermiculture. Technically,  

the worm castings are pure worm waste and are fine and nutrient rich organic soil amendment. Vermicompost on the other hand, is comprised of the castings, bits of bedding and other organic matter. Essentially, though the terms are used interchangeably, they are both worm manure and are valuable for improving soil health. Applications of earthworm in technology of composting and bioremediation of soils and other activities is called Vermitech (Sultan Ismail, 1992).

The disposal of solid wastes (bio- degradable and non- biodegradable) remains a serious challenge in most of the countries. Earthworms play a vital role in maintaining soil fertility; hence these worms are called as **“farmer’s friends”**. These are also called as **“biological indicators of soil fertility”**. The reason is that they support bacteria, fungi, protozoans and a host of other organisms which are essential for sustaining a healthy soil. The breakdown of organic matter by the activity of the earthworms and its elimination from its body is called vermicast. It is a finely divided granular material and is noted for its porosity, aeration, drainage and moisture holding capacity and serves as rich organic manure.

Earthworms are divided into two major groups. The first group, the **humus formers,** dwell on the surface and feed on organic matter. They are generally darker in colour. These worms are used for vermicomposting. The second group, the **humus feeders,** are burrowing worms that are useful in making the soil porous, and mixing and distributing humus through out the soil. There are different **endemic** (native) species of earthworms cultured




  

in India for vermicomposting such as _Periyonyx excavatus, Lampito mauritii, Octochaetona serrata._ Some earthworm species have been introduced from other countries and called as **exotic species** Eg. _Eisenia fetida, Eudrilus eugeniae._

**Vermicomposting**

**Vermicompost** is the compost produced by the action of earthworms in association with all other organisms in the compost unit. Vermicompost bed may be selected on upland or an elevated level as it prevents the stagnation of water. You may construct a cement pit of 3x2x1m size (LxWxD) over ground surface using bricks. The size of pit may vary as per availability of raw materials. Cement pot or well rings are practically good. Provision should be made for excess water to drain. The vermibed should not be exposed to direct sunlight and hence shade may be provided (Figure. 13.1). The first layer of vermibed contains gravel at about 5 cm in height, followed by coarse sand to a thickness of 3.5 cm, which will facilitate the drainage of excess water.

Earthworms collected from native soil prefer a layer of local soil in their compost beds. If local soil earthworms are used, add a layer of native loamy soil for about 15 cm

on top of the gravel sand layer and introduce earthworms into it. For exotic species such as _Eisenia fetida_ and _Eudrilus eugeniae,_the layer of soil is not needed. The unit can now be loaded with digested biomass or animal dung such as cow dung that has lost its heat. The number of earthworms to be introduced in an unit depends on the size of the vermibed prepared. Earthworms such as _Periyonyx excavatus, Eisenia fetida_ or _Eudrilus eugeniae_ are introduced on the top. Jute bags or cardboards or broad leaves are used to cover the unit. As worms require moisture, water management is most important for the survival of the earthworms. Too little or too much of water is not good for the worms.

Earthworms release their castings on the surface. One can start harvesting this from the surface on noticing the castings on the surface. It may take several days for the entire biomass to be composted depending on the amount of biomass. When all the compost is harvested, earthworms can be handpicked by creating small conical heaps of harvested compost and leaving in sunlight for a few hours. The earthworms then move down and settle at the bottom of the heap as a cluster. Earthworms from the lower layers of the compost can be recovered and the worms can be transferred to new composting units.

of vermibed. It is useful as a foliar spray to enhance plant growth and yield. It is obtained from the burrows or **drilospheres** formed by earthworms. Nutrients, plant growth promoter substances and some useful microorganisms are present in vermiwash.

Earthworms can be used for recycling of waste food, leaf, litter and biomass to prepare a good fertilizer in container known as **wormery** or **wormbin**.

**Earthworm Pests and Diseases** Earthworms are subjected to attack by a variety of pests. Most outbreaks are the result of poor bed management. Earthworm enemies include ants, springtails, centipedes, slugs, mites, certain beetle larvae, birds, rats, snakes, mice, toads, and other insects or animals which feed on worms. The earthworm has a number of internal parasites including numerous protozoa, some nematodes, and the larvae of certain flies. Larger predators can be excluded from worm beds by proper construction of the bins, and by use of screens or gratings at the bottom and top of the beds.

My vermicompost manufacturing unit is plagued by a number of red ants. Are there any bio-friendly measures to tackle the menace as I do not want to use any chemicals?

**Advantages of Using Vermicompost** People are aware about benefits of organic inputs in farming. Vermicompost is excellent organic manure for sustainable agro- practices. So, marketing vermicompost is now a potential and flourishing industry. Retail marketing of vermicompost in urban areas is most promising. Vermicompost is neatly packed in designed and printed packets for sale. People of different age groups  

are involved in the production and selling of vermicompost. Marketing of vermicompost can provide a supplementary income.

i. Vermicompost is rich in essential plant nutrients.

ii. It improves soil structure texture, aeration, and water holding capacity and prevents soil erosion

iii. Vermicompost is a rich in nutrients and an eco-friendly amendment to soil for farming and terrace gardening.

iv. It enhances seed germination and ensures good plant growth

## Sericulture
 Silk is Nature’s gift to mankind and a commercial fiber of animal origin other than wool. Being eco-friendly, biodegradable and self-sustaining material; silk has assumed special relevance in present age. Sericulture is an agro –based industry, the term which denotes commercial production of silk through silkworm rearing. Historical evidence reveals that sericulture was practiced in China long back and they preserved the secret for more than 3000 years and maintained monopoly in silk trade with the rest of the world. According to Western historians, mulberry cultivation spread to India about 140BC from China through Tibet. The fabulous silk from China and India were carried to European countries. The 7000 mile lengthy road, historically called the “**Silk road**” passing through Baghdad, Tashkent, Damascus and Istanbul was used for silk transport. Today more than 29 countries in the world are practicing sericulture and producing different kinds of silk. India stands second in silk production next to China.

Production of silk from the silk worm, by rearing practices on a commercial




  

scale is called sericulture. It is an agro- based industry comprising three main components: i) cultivation of food plants for the silkworms, ii) rearing of silkworms, and iii) reeling and spinning of silk. The

first two are agricultural and the last one is an industrial component. Only few species of silkworms are used in the sericulture industry (Table 13. 1 and Figure 13. 2).

**Life cycle of _Bombyx mori_** The adult of Bombyx mori is about 2.5 cm in length and pale creamy white in colour. Due to heavy body and feeble wings, flight is not possible by the female moth. This moth is unisexual in nature and does not feed during its very short life period of 2-3 days. Just after emergence, male moth copulates with female for about 2-3 hours and if not separated, they may die after few hours of copulating with female. Just after copulation, female starts egg laying which is completed in1-24 hours. A single female moth lays 400 to 500 eggs depending upon the climatic conditions. Two types of eggs are generally found namely diapause type and non-diapause type. The diapause type is laid by silkworms inhabiting the temperate regions, whereas silkworms belonging to subtropical regions like India lay non-diapause type of eggs. The eggs after ten days of incubation hatch into larva called as caterpillar. The newly hatched caterpillar is

about 3 mm in length and is pale, yellowish- white in colour. The caterpillars are provided with well developed mandibulate type of mouth-parts adapted to feed easily on the mulberry leaves.

After 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th moultings caterpillars get transformed into 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th instars respectively (Figure13.3). It takes about 21 to 25 days after hatching. The fully grown caterpillar is 7.5 cm in length. It develops salivary glands, stops feeding and undergoes pupation. The caterpillars stop feeding and move towards the corner among the leaves and secretes a sticky fluid through their silk gland. The secreted fluid comes out through spinneret (a narrow pore situated on the hypopharynx) and takes the form of long fine thread of silk which hardens on exposure to air and is wrapped around the body of caterpillar in the form




of a covering called as cocoon. It is the white coloured bed of the pupa whose outer threads are irregular while the inner threads are regular. The length of continuous thread secreted by a caterpillar for the formation of cocoon is about 1000-1200 metres which requires 3 days to complete. The pupal period lasts for 10 to 12 days and the pupae cut through the cocoon and emerge into adult moth.

On the basis of the moults which they undergo during their larval life, _B. mori_ is divided into three races – tri-moulters, tetra- moulters and penta- moulters. Based on

voltinism (the number of broods raised per year), three kinds of races are recognized in mulberry silkworm – univoltines (one brood only), bivoltines (two broods only) and multivoltines (more than two broods).

**Cultivation of food plants for the silkworms** The first component, is to grow the food plants for the silkworms. Mulberry leaves

India has the distinction of producing all the four types of silk i.e. (a) Mulberry silk (91.7%); (b) Tasar silk (1.4%); (c) Eri silk (6.4%); and (d) Muga silk (0.5%) which are produced by different species of silkworms. Name the species that produces large amount and least amount of silk in India.

are widely used as food for silkworm _Bombyx mori_ and the cultivation of mulberry is called as **Moriculture**. Presently improved mulberry varieties like Victory1, S36, G2 and G4 which can withstand various agro - climatic and soil conditions are used for planting. The favourable season for cultivating of the mulberry plants is June, July, November and December. The mulberry crop production technology includes land preparation, preparation of cutting, planting techniques, maintenance of mulberry nursery, disease and pest management and uprooting for raising new mulberry gardens. Mulberry is also being grown as tree plant at an height of 123-152 cm with 20 x 20 cm or 25 x 25 cm spacing to harvest better silkworm cocoon crops.

**Rearing of silkworms** The second component is the rearing of silkworm. A typical rearing house (6m x 4m x 3.5m) is constructed on an elevated place under shade to accommodate 100 dfls (disease free layings). Space of 1m should be provided surrounding the rearing house. Sufficient windows and ventilators should be provided for free circulation of air inside the rearing house. The windows and ventilators should be covered with nylon net to restrict the entry of uzi flies and other insects. Apart from the specified area of the rearing house; the following appliances such as hygrometer, power sprayers, rearing stands, foam pads, wax coated paraffin papers, nylon nets, baskets for keeping leaves, gunny bags, rotary or bamboo mountages and drier are needed for effective rearing of silkworms. The steps involved in rearing process of  

silkworm are disinfection of rearing house, incubation of eggs, brushing, young larval rearing and late age larval rearing.

The selected healthy silk moths are allowed to mate for 4 hours. Female moth is then kept in a dark plastic bed, it lays about 400 eggs in 24 hours; the female is taken out, crushed and examined for any disease, only certified disease-free eggs are reared for industrial purpose. The eggs are incubated in an incubator. The small larvae (caterpillars) hatch between 7-10 days. These larvae are kept in trays inside a rearing house at a temperature of about 20°C - 25°C. These are first fed on chopped mulberry leaves. After 4-5 days fresh leaves are provided. As the larvae grow, they are transferred to fresh leaves on clean trays, when fully grown they spin cocoons. Their maturity is achieved in about 45 days. At this stage the salivary glands (silk glands) starts secreting silk to spin cocoons.

**Post cocoon processing** The method of obtaining silk thread from the cocoon is known as post cocoon processing. This includes **stifling** and **reeling.**

The process of killing the cocoons is called stifling. The process of removing the threads from the killed cocoon is called reeling. For reeling silk the cocoons are gathered about 8 -10 days after spinning had begun. The cocoons are first treated by steam or dry heat to kill the insect inside. This is necessary to prevent the destruction of the continuous fibre by the emergence of the moth. The cocoons are then soaked in hot water (95° -97°C) for 10-15 minutes to soften the gum that binds the silk threads together. This process is called cooking. The “cooked” cocoons




  

are kept in hot water and the loose ends of the thread are caught by hand. Threads from several cocoons are wound together on spinning wheels (Charakhas) to form the reels of raw silk. Only about one- half of the silk of each cocoon is reelable, the remainder is used as a silk waste and formed into spun silk. Raw silk thus obtained is processed through several treatments to bring about the luster on the thread.

New silkworm diet produces coloured silk. The Institute of Materials Research and

Engineering (IMRE) in Singapore has developed a way to replace the traditional dying process necessary to make coloured silk. A simple dietary change (feeding a diet of mulberries treated with fluorescent dye) for the silkworm larva and they are able to produce silk in a variety of colors. The colour directly integrated into the fibers.

**Uses of Silk** 1\. Silk fibers are utilized in preparing silk

clothes. Silk fibers are now combined  

with other natural or synthetic fibers to manufacture clothes like **Teri-Silk, Cot-Silk** etc. Silk is dyed and printed to prepare ornamented fabrics. They are generally made from Eri-silk or spun silk.

2\. Silk is used in industries and for military purposes.

3\. It is used in the manufacture of fishing fibers, parachutes, cartridge bags, insulation coils for telephone, wireless receivers, tyres of racing cars, filter fibres, in medical dressings and as suture materials.

**Diseases and Pests of Silkworm:**

The profitable silk industry is threatened by various diseases caused by the virus, fungal, bacterial and protozoan infections but also by insect predators, birds and other higher animals. Ants, crows, kites, rats, feed upon silk worms thereby causing a great loss to silk industry. Pebrine, is a dangerous disease to in silkworms and the causative organism is Nosema bombycis , a protozoan. This silkworm disease is transmitted through the egg of the mother silkworm and also through ingestion of contaminated food. Flacherie generally occurs in the mature larvae and is caused mainly by bacteria like _Streptococcus_ and _Staphylococcus_. Grasserie is a most dominant and serious viral disease. It is caused by _Bombyx mori_ nuclear polyhedrosis virus (BmNPV) a _Baculovirus_, which belongs to sub group ‘A’ of the Baculoviridae. Among the fungal diseases, white muscardine is common. This disease is caused by fungus _Beauveria bassiana_.




  

## Apiculture
 Ever since the beginning of civilization, man has been trying to make use of organisms around him for various purposes and to rear them for increasing their number. One of the finest discoveries is our knowledge regarding the procurement of honey collected by honey bees. Care and management of honey bees on a commercial scale for the production of honey is called **Apiculture** or **Bee Keeping**. The word ‘apiculture’ comes from the Latin word ’_apis_’ meaning bee. Bees are reared in apiaries that are areas where a lot of bee hives can be placed. There are five well recognized types of bees in the world. They are Apis dorsata (Rock bee), Apis florea (Little bee), _Apis indica_ (Indian bee), _Apis mellifera_ (European bee) and _Apis adamsoni_ (African bee).

**Social organization of honey bees** In honey bees, a highly organized division of labour is found. A well developed honey bee colony consists of the Queen, Drones and Workers (Figure 13.4). All the three types depend on each other for their existence. There is normally one queen, 10,000 to 30,000 workers and few hundred drones (male bees) in a colony.

**Queen** **bee** is a functional female bee present in each hive and feeds on Royal Jelly. Its sole function is to lay eggs throughout its life span. The virgin queen bee mates only once in her life. During the breeding season in winter, a unique flight takes place by the queen bee followed by several drones. This flight is called “nuptial flight”. The queen bee produces a hormonal chemical substance called pheromone. The drones in the area are  

attracted to the pheromone and mating takes place. During mating, the drone releases large number of sperms for sufficient fertilization. In a life span of two to four years, a queen bee lays about 15 lakh eggs. When the queen bee loses its capacity to lay eggs, another worker bee starts feeding on the Royal Jelly and develops into a new queen.

Among the honey bees, **workers** are sterile females and smallest but yet function as the main spring of the complicated machinery in the colony. Worker bee lives in a chamber called ‘Worker Cell’ and it takes about 21 days to develop from the egg to adult and its lifespan is about six weeks. Each worker has to perform different types of work in her life time. During the first half of her life, she becomes a nurse bee attending to indoor duties such as secretion of royal jelly, prepares bee-bread to feed the larvae, feeds the queen, takes care of the queen and drones, secretes bees wax, builds combs, cleans and fans the bee hive.

Honey bee uses its long-tube like tongue to extract sugary liquid called nectar from the flowers. The nectar is stored in the stomach and the enzyme _invertase transforms it into honey. This_ increases the storage life of honey and also contributes to its medicinal value.




  

Then she becomes a soldier and guards the bee hive. In the second half her life lasting for three weeks, she searches and gathers the pollen, nectar, propolis and water.

The drone is the functional male member of the colony which develops from an unfertilized egg. It lives in a chamber called drone cell. Drones totally depend on workers for honey. The sole duty of the drone is to fertilize the virgin queen hence called “King of the colony”. During swarming (the process of leaving the colony by the queen with a large group of worker bees to form a new colony) the drones follows the queen, copulates and dies after copulation.

**Structure of a Bee Hive** The house of honey bee is termed as bee hive or comb. The hive consists of hexagonal cells made up of wax secreted by the abdomen of worker bees arranged in opposite rows on a common base. These hives are found hanging vertically from the rocks, building or branches of trees. The young stages of honey bees accommodate the lower and central cells of the hive called the **brood cells**. In _Apis dorsata_, the brood cells are of similar in size and shape but in other species, brood cells are of three types _viz_., queen cell for

Queen Worker Drone




queens, worker cell for workers and drone cells for drones (Figure.13.5). The cells are intended for storage of honey and pollen in the upper portion of the comb whereas the lower portions are for brood rearing.

**Methods of Bee keeping** The main objective is to get more and more quality honey. There are two methods used by apiculturists. They are indigenous method and the modern method. In indigenous method, the honey extracted from the comb contains wax. To overcome the drawbacks of the indigenous method, the modern method has been developed to improve the texture of hives. In India, there are two types of beehives in practice namely, **Langstroth** and **Newton.**

The Langstroth bee hive is made up of wood and consists of six parts (Figure 13.6) namely **Stand, Bottom board, Brood chamber, Super, Inner cover** and **Top cover.** Besides the above primary equipments, other accessory equipments are used in beekeeping. They are **Queen Excluder, Comb foundation, Bee gloves, Bee veil**, **Smoker, Hive Tool, Uncapping knife, Bee brush, Queen introducing cage, Feeder, Honey Extractor** and **Hive Entrance Guard .**

**Products of bee keeping and their economic importance** The chief products of bee keeping industry are honey and bee wax.

**Honey** is the healthier substitute for sugar. The major constituents of honey are: levulose, dextrose, maltose, other sugars, enzymes, pigments, ash and water. It is an aromatic sweet material derived from nectar of plants. It is a natural food, the smell and taste depends upon the pollen taken by the honey bee. It is used as an antiseptic, laxative and as a sedative. It is generally used in Ayurvedic and Unani systems of medicine. It is also used in the preparation of cakes, breads and biscuits

**Bee wax** is secreted by the abdomen of the worker bees at the age of two weeks. The wax is masticated and mixed with the secretions of the cephalic glands to convert it into a plastic resinous substance. The resinous chemical substance present in the wax is called **propolis** which is derived from pollen grains. The pure wax is white in colour and the yellow colour is due to the presence of carotenoid pigments. It is used for making candles, water proofing materials, polishes for  

floors, furniture, appliances, leather and taps. It is also used for the production of comb foundation sheets in bee keeping and used in pharmaceutical industries.

Bees teach us a lesson to work with cooperation. Imagine the hardwork of

the bees! A single honey bee travels about double the distance of the circumference of the earth’s globe for preparing 453.5ml of honey.

## Lac Culture
 The culture of lac insect using techniques for the procurement of lac on large scale is known as Lac culture. Lac is produced by the lac insect _Tachardia lacca_ previously known as _Laccifer lacca._ It is a minute, resinous crawling scale insect which inserts its probosics into the plant tissues and sucks juice, grows and secretes lac from the hind end of the body as a protective covering for its body. Moreover the insect is a parasite on host plants i.e., Karanagalli (_Acacia catechu_), Karuvelai (_Acacia nilotica_) and Kumbadiri (_Schleichera oleosa_). The quality of lac depends upon the quality of the host plant. The female lac insect is responsible for large scale production of lac, which is larger than the male lac insect.

**Economic importance of Lac** a. Lac is largely used as a sealing wax

and adhesive for optical instruments. It is used in electric industry, as it is a good insulator.

b. It is used in preparations of shoe and leather polishes and as a protective coating of wood.




  

c. It is used in laminating paper board, photographs, engraved materials and plastic moulded articles.

d. Used as a filling material for gold ornaments

## Aquaponics
 Aquaponics is a technique which is a combination of aquaculture (growing fish) and hydroponics (growing plants in non-soil media and nutrient-laden water). Aquaponics may also prevent toxic water runoff. It also maintains ecosystem balance by recycling the waste and excretory products produced by the fish. In India, aquaponics was started in 2013. Some primary methods of aquaponic gardening that are in use nowadays are as follows: (i) **Deep water culture** is otherwise known as raft based method. In this method a raft floats in water. Plants are kept in the holes of raft and the roots float in water. This method is applicable for larger commercial scale system. By this method fast growing plants are cultivated. (ii) **Media based method** involves growing plants in inert planting media like clay pellets or shales. This method is applicable for home and hobby scale system. Larger number of fruiting plants, leafy green plants, herbs and other varieties of plants can be cultivated (Figure 13. 7) (iii) **Nutrient Film technique** involves the passage of nutrient rich water through a narrow trough or PVC pipe. Plants are kept in the holes of the pipe to allow the roots to be

Hyper-parasitism - A condition in which a secondary parasite develops within

a previously existing parasite or a hyperparasite is the parasite whose host is also a parasite.  

in free contact with in the water stream. (iv) **Aqua vertica** is otherwise known as vertical aquaponics. Plants are stacked on the top of each other in tower systems. Water flows in through the top of the tower. This method is suitable for growing leafy greens, strawberries and other crops that do not need supporting solid substratum to grow.

**Advantages of Aquaponic gardening Water conservation**: No need of water discharge and recharge as the water is maintained by recycling process.

**Soil**: Bottom soil may be loaded with freshwater. Microbes in water can convert the waste materials into usable forms like ammonia into nitrates which are used by the plants. Thus the soil fertility is maintained

**Pesticides**: In this system use of pesticides is avoided and hence it is eco- friendly.

**Weeds**: Since the plants are cultured in confined conditions, growth of weeds is completely absent. The utilization of nutrient by plants is high in this method

**Artificial food for fishes**: In this system plant waste and decays are utilized by fishes as food. So, the need for the use of supplementary feed can be minimized.

**Fertilizer usage**: Artificial or chemical fertilizers is not required for this system since the plants in the aquaponics utilize the nutrients from the fish wastes dissolved in water

a. Growing fish or other aquatic animals and plants together in an integrated system. The fish wastes provides nutrients for the plants and the plants filter the water. Additionally bacteria break down by-products such as ammonia.

b. Growing plants in a nutrient solution instead of soil. Fish kept in the water provide the required nutrients. Write the appropriate scientific terms for above (a) and (b) and differentiate between them..  

Cultivable fishes like tilapia, trout, koi, gold fish, bass etc., are cultured in aquaponics. Common cultivable plants like tomato, pepper, lettuce, cucumber, and rose are co-cultivated in this method.

## Aquaculture
 Aquaculture has been practiced in varying forms for centuries dating to the time of the Phoenicians. India offers a huge potential for aquaculture development. Fish culture received

notable attention in Tamil Nadu in 1911. Aquaculture is a branch of science that deals with the farming of aquatic organisms such as fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants.

On the basis of source, aquaculture can be classified into three categories. They are (a) **Freshwater aquaculture** (b) **Brackish water aquaculture** (c) **Marine water aquaculture. Culturing of fishes is called** fish culture or pisciculture. Inland water bodies include freshwater bodies like rivers, canals, streams, lakes, flood plain wetlands, reservoirs, ponds, tanks and other derelict water bodies and ponds constructed for fresh water aquaculture. The pH of the freshwater should be around neutral and salinity below 5 ppt (parts per thousand).

Brackish water fishes spend most of its life in river mouths (estuaries) back




  

waters, mangrove swamps and coastal lagoons. Estuarine fish are more common in Bengal and Kerala. Culturing of animals in the water having salinity range 0.5 2 30 ppt are called as brackish water culture. Fishes cultured in brackish water are Milk fish (_Chanos Chanos)_, Sea bass (‘Koduva’), Grey mullet (‘Madavai’)_,_ _Pearl spots (‘Kari’meen)_ etc,

Marine Fisheries deal with fishing operations along seacoasts. The Indian subcontinent approximately has a 5600 kms long coastline. About 80% of India’s marine fish are supplied by the west coast and the remaining 20% by the east coast. The premier varieties are mackerels, sardines, sharks, and catfish. Marine edible fishes of Tamilnadu coast include both cartilaginous and bony fishes. Culturing of animals in the water salinity ranges from 30 - 35 ppt is called Mariculture. Some fishes like Chanos sp, _Mugil cephalus_ are cultured here. Culturing of animals in the salinity ranges from 36 - 40 ppt is called Metahaline culture. Eg, Brine shrimp (_Artemia salina)_. Artemia is commonly known as the brine shrimp. It is a crustacean and lives in high saline waters because of its high osmoregulatory capacity.

### Fish culture Characteristics of cultivable fishes
 The special characteristic features of cultivable fishes are:

i. Fishes should have high growth rate in short period for culture.

ii. They should accept supplementary diet. iii. They should be hardy enough to resist

some common diseases and infection of parasites.

iv. Fishes proposed for polyculture should be able to live together without interfering or attacking other fishes.  

v. They should have high conversion efficiency so that they can effectively utilize the food.

**Types of cultivable fish** Cultivable fish are of 3 types(Figure 13. 8).

a. Indigenous or native fresh water fishes (Major carps, _Catla_, _Labeo_, _Clarias_)

b. Salt water fishes acclimatized for fresh water (_Chanos_, Mullet).

c. Exotic fishes or imported from other counties (Common carps)

Among these, major carps have proved to be best suited for culture in India, because the carps 1. Feed on zooplanktons and

phytoplanktons, decaying weeds, debris and other aquatic plants.

2\. They can survive in turbid water with slightly higher temperature

3\. Can tolerate O2 variations in water. 4. Can be transported from one place to

other easily. 5. They are highly nutritive and palatable.

**External factors affecting fish culture** The factors that affect fish culture are temperature, light, rain, water, flood, water current, turbidity of water, pH hardness, salinity and dissolved O2. Light and temperature also play an important role in fish breeding.

**Management of fish farm** To culture fish, one should have an idea about different stages of fish culture such as topographic situation, quality, source, physical, chemical and biological factors of water. Breeding, hatching, nursing, rearing and stocking fishes in ponds has to be managed properly. Keeping in view the various stages of fishes, the following different types of ponds have been recommended to manage them.

**Breeding pond** The first step in fish culture is the breeding of fishes, therefore, for proper breeding special types of ponds are prepared called breeding ponds. These ponds are prepared near the rivers or other natural water resources.

**Types of breeding** Depending on the mode of breeding, they are divided into 1. **Natural breeding** (Bundh breeding) These are special types of ponds where natural riverine conditions or any natural water resources are managed for breeding of culturable fishes. There bundhs are constructed in large low-lying areas that can accommodate large quantity of rain water. The shallow area of such bundhs is used as spawning ground. 2. **Induced breeding** The fish seed is commonly collected from breeding grounds but does not guarantee  

that all fish seeds belong to the same species. Hence advanced techniques have been developed to improve the quality of fish seed by artificial method of fertilization and induced breeding. Artificial fertilization involves removal of ova and sperm from female and male by artificial mechanical process and the eggs are fertilized. For artificial fertilization the belly of mature female fish is held upward. Stripping is done with the thumb of the right hand from the anterior to posterior direction for the ejection of eggs due to force. In this way eggs are collected separately. Further, the male fish is caught with its belly downwards. The milt of fish is striped and collected separately, and then the eggs are fertilized.

Induced breeding is also done by hypophysation (removal of pituitary gland). The gonadotropin hormone (FSH and LH) secreted by the pituitary gland influences the maturation of gonads and spawning in fishes. Pituitary gland is removed from a healthy mature fish. Pituitary extract is prepared by homogenising in 0.3% saline or glycerine and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 8000rpm. The supernatant is injected intramuscularly at the base of the caudal fin or intra-peritonealy at the base of pectoral fin. Male and female fishes start to spawn (release of gametes) and eggs are fertilized. The fertilized eggs are removed from the spawning place and kept into hatching **hapas**.

**Fish seed** Fish seed is collected from breeding ponds. The spawn collecting net is commonly called Benchijal (Shooting net) and transferred to the hatching pits.




  

**Hatching pit** The fertilized eggs are kept in hatching pits. The hatching pits should be nearer to the breeding grounds, should be smaller in size with good quality water. There are two types of hatching pits, hatcheries are small sized pond in which unfertilized eggs are transferred and hatching happens. Hatching hapas are rectangular trough shaped tanks made up of mosquito net cloth supported by bamboo poles and fixed in the river (Figure 13.9).

**Nursery pond** The newly hatched fries are transported from the hatching happa to nursery ponds where they grow into fingerlings.

**Rearing pond** Fingerlings are transferred to rearing ponds that is long and narrow and allows long distance swimming. The rearing pond should be free from toxicants and predators. Antibiotics are used for washing the fingerlings and then transferred to the stocking ponds.

**Stocking pond** Stocking ponds should be devoid of weeds and predatory fishes. Proper organic

**Figure 13.9 A fish pond-showing** fish breeding hapas  

manuring should be done to increase the production with cow dung and chemical fertilizing should also be done.

**Harvesting** Harvesting is done to capture the fishes from the water. Well grown fishes are taken out for marketing. Small sized fishes are again released into the stocking ponds for further growth. Different methods of fishing are carried out to harvest fishes. These include Stranding, Angling, Traps, Dipnets, Cast nets, Gill nets, Drag nets and purse nets. The harvested fishes are preserved by refrigeration, Deep freezing, freeze drying, sun drying, salting, smoking and canning.

**Composite fish farming** Few selected fishes belonging to different species are stocked together in proper proportion in a pond. This mixed farming is termed composite fish farming or polyculture. The advantages include, 1. All available niches are fully utilized. 2. Compatible species do not harm each other. 3. No competition among different

species is found. 4. _Catla catla,_ _Labeo rohita_ and _Cirrhinus_

_mrigala_ are the commonly used fish species for composite fish farming.

**Exotic fishes** The fishes imported into a country for fish culture are called exotic fishes and such fish culture is known as exotic fish culture. Examples of such exotic fishes introduced in India are _Cyprinus carpio_ and _Oreochromis mossambicus_.

**Disease Management** Diseases can be of viral or bacterial origin. Regular monitoring of parameters




  

like water quality, aeration, regular feeding, observation for mortality should be checked. Parasitic infestations and microbial infections should be observed periodically.

**Economic importance of fish** Fishes form a rich source of protein food and provide a good staple food to tide over the nutritional needs of man. Fish species such as sardines, mackerel, tuna, herrings have high amino acids concentrations particularly histidine which is responsible for the meaty flavor of the flesh. It is rich in fat such as omega 3 fatty acids. Minerals such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, iron, manganese, iodine and copper. Some of the fish by - products are:

**Fish oil** is the most important fish by product. It is derived from fish liver and from the fish body. Fish liver oil is derived from the liver which is rich in vitamin A and D, whereas fish body oil has high content of iodine, not suitable for human consumption, but is used in the manufacture of laundry soaps, paints and cosmetics.

**Fish meal** is prepared from fish waste after extracting oil from the fish. The dried wastes are used to prepare food for pig, poultry and cattle. The wastes obtained during the preparation of fish meal are widely used as manure.

**Isinglass** is a high-grade collagen produced from dried air bladder or swim bladder of certain fishes viz. catfish and carps. The processed bladder which is dissolved in hot water forms a gelatin having adhesive property. It is primarily used for clarification of wine, beer and vinegar.  

Why are fish so efficient at converting feed to flesh?

### Prawn Culture


Most important aquatic crustacean is prawn, which is widely cultured prawn flesh is palatable and rich in glycogen, protein with low fat content. Types of prawn fishery **1\. Shallow water prawn fishery** – located

on the west coast restricted to shallow waters.

**2\. Estuaries and back waters or saline lake prawn fishery** \- The area of production of prawns are the back waters seen along the Western coast, Ennur, Pulicat, Chilka lake and Estuaries of Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers.

**3\. Freshwater prawn fishery** - Prawns are caught from the rivers and lakes throughout India.

**4\. Marine prawn fishery – Most of the** marine prawns are caught along the Indian coast belonging to the family Penaeidae.

**Species of prawn** A number of species of prawn are distributed in water resources such as _Penaeus indicus, Penaeus monodon, Metapenaeus dobsoni and Macrobrachium rosenbergii._

**Culture of freshwater prawn** _Macrobrachium rosenbergii_ (Figure 13.10) is commonly seen in rivers, fields and low- saline estuaries. The prawn collected from ponds, river, and paddy fields are transferred to the tanks which are aerated. For




  

fertilization, one pair of prawn are kept in a separate tank. After mating, the eggs are laid. Spawning tanks of different sizes should be prepared with proper aeration. Temperature (240 C – 300 C) and pH (7-8) should be maintained in the hatching tank. The eggs hatch into first and second stage larva. Artificial feed is supplied. Young ones of 5cm length (60 days old) can be reared in fresh or slightly brackish water ponds and paddy fields. Harvesting of prawns can be done twice in a year.

**Culture of marine prawn** Several factors that determine the success of marine prawn culture includes selection of site, water quality, soil quality and availability of seed.

**Preparation of farm** For the preparation of ponds for algal growth and for the subsequent stocking of prawns it is essential to drain off the water and sundry the bottom followed by light tilling. Agricultural lime should be applied to absorb excess CO2 and to supply calcium which is required for moulting. Fertilizers like rice, bran, poultry, and cattle dung are used to increase the fertility of the soil. Prawns are commonly caught in crafts and gears using different types of nets such as cast nets, bag nets, drag nets, trawl nets and barrier nets. Preservation of prawns is done by peeling and deveining or by cooking and peeling.




### Pearl Culture


Pearl is a white, highly shining globular concretion found within the shell of an Oyster. Pearl oysters are sedentary animals. In India it was cultured for the first time in 1973 at Thoothukudi. Pearl oysters are found along the coast of Kanyakumari and in the Gulf of Kutch. High quality pearls are obtained from pearl oysters of Genus _Pinctada_ that can be cultured in the salinity range of 30 ppt in racks, raft and long line methods. Freshwater bivalve _Lamellidens_ is also used in artificial pearl culture. Mostly the pearl oysters inhabit the ridges of rocks or dead corals, forming extensive pearl banks. These pearl beds produce best quality of pearls called as “Lingha Pearl”.

**Pearl Formation** When a foreign particle accidently enters into the space between mantle and shell of the oyster, it adheres to the mantle. The mantle epithelium encloses it like a sac and starts to secrete concentric layers of nacre around it as a defensive mechanism. Nacre is secreted continuously by the epithelial layer of the mantle and is deposited around the foreign particle and over a period time the formation of repeated layers of calcium carbonate makes the hard and glossy pearl. When the pearl enlarges the oyster dies. The shell is then carefully opened and the pearls are manually separated and graded (Figure 13. 11).

**Composition of pearl** Pearl comprises of water, organic matter, calcium carbonate and the residue. (1) Water: 2-4% (2) Organic matter:

3.5-5.9% (3) Calcium (4) Residue: 0.1-0.8% carbonate: 90%




  

**Quality of pearl** The pearls obtained are of variable shapes and sizes. They may be white, or cream red or pink red in colour. The spherical pearls of rainbow colour are rarely found. The best quality of pearl is obtained from marine oysters. Pearl obtained from freshwater bivalves are not as valuable as those obtained from the marine oysters (Mishra, 1961).

## Animal Husbandry and Management


Animal husbandry is the practice of breeding and raising livestock cattles like cows, buffaloes, and goats and birds etc. that are useful to human beings. Parameters such as adequate ventilation, temperature, sufficient light, water and proper housing accommodation should be taken into account to maintain dairy and poultry farms. Animals should be cared and protected from diseases. Records should be maintained after the regular visits by Veterinarian. More over the selection of good breeds with high yielding potential combined and resistance to diseases is very important.

**Animal Breeding** Human beings have been depending on animals and animal products for food from very early times. Generally high yielding animals produced by hybridization are reared in poultry and dairy farms. In earlier days, animals were produced and selected based on specific characters. With the gain in knowledge on the principles of heredity and genetics, human beings have been successful in rearing animals with the superior qualities through hybridization experiments. Complex issues are faced by

M  

the animal breeder during hybridization experiments. Hence animals with maximum desirable characters should be selected.

A group of animals related by descent and with similar characters like general appearance, features, size etc., are said to belong to a breed. Why should we breed animals? Through animal breeding, improved breeds of animals can be produced by improving their genotype through selective breeding.

**Objectives of Animal breeding:** a. To improve growth rate b. Enhancing the production of milk,

meat. Egg etc., c. Increasing the quality of the animal

products d. Improved resistance to diseases e. Increased reproductive rate

**Methods of Animal breeding:** There are two methods of animal breeding, namely inbreeding and outbreeding **1\. Inbreeding:** Breeding between animals of the same breed for 4-6 generations is called inbreeding. Inbreeding increases

homozygosity and exposes the harmful recessive genes. Continuous inbreeding reduces fertility and even productivity, resulting in “inbreeding depression”. This can be avoided by breeding selected animals of the breeding population and they should be mated with superior animals of the same breed but unrelated to the breeding population. It helps to restore fertility and yield. **2\. Outbreeding: The breeding between** unrelated animals is called outbreeding. Individuals produced do not have common ancestors for 4-6 generations. Outbreeding helps to produce new and favourable traits, to produce hybrids with superior qualities and helps to create new breeds. New and favourable genes can be introduced into a population through outbreeding.

i. **Out crossing**: It is the breeding between unrelated animals of the same breed but having no common ancestry. The offspring of such a cross is called outcross. This method is suitable for breeding animals below average in productivity.

ii. **Cross breeding:** Breeding between a superior male of one breed with a superior female of another breed. The cross bred progeny has superior traits (hybrid vigour or heterosis).

iii. **Interspecific hybridization:** In this method of breeding mating is

between male and female of two different species. The progeny obtained from such crosses are different from their parents, and may possess the desirable traits of the parents. Have you heard about Mule? It was produced by the process of interspecific hybridization between a male donkey and a female horse.  

**Controlled breeding experiments Artificial insemination:** Artificial insemination is a technique in which the semen collected from the male is injected to the reproductive tract of the selected female. Artificial insemination is economical measure where fewer bulls are required and maximum use can be made of the best sire.

**Advantages of artificial insemination** i. It increases the rate of conception

ii. It avoids genital diseases iii. Semen can be collected from injured

bulls which have desirable traits. iv. Superior animals located apart can be

bred successfully.

**Multiple ovulation embryo transfer technology (MOET)** It is another method of propagation of animals with desirable traits. This method is applied when the success rate of crossing is low even after artificial insemination. In this method Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is administered to cows for inducing follicular maturation and super ovulation. Instead of one egg per cycle, 6-8 eggs can be produced by this technology. The eggs are carefully recovered non-surgically from the genetic mother and fertilized artificially.

Thawing means to melt or become liquid. When the semen collected for artificial insemination is taken to far off places/stored for a long time in frozen condition it should be brought to room temperature slowly before use. This process is called thawing.




  

The embryos at 8-32 celled stages are recovered and transferred to a surrogate mother. For another round of ovulation, the same genetic mother is utilized. This technology can be applied to cattle, sheep and buffaloes. Advantage of this technology is to produce high milk yielding females and high-quality meat yielding bulls in a short time.

**Breeds of Dairy animals** Dairying is the production and marketing of milk and its products. Dairy operation consists of proper maintenance of cattle, the collection and processing the milk and its by products. There are 26 well defined breeds of cattle and 6 breeds of buffaloes in India. Cattles are classified under three groups based on the purpose they serve to man (Figure 13. 12). They are

i. Dairy breeds or Milch breeds: They are high milk yielders with extended lactation. Eg., Sindhi, Gir, Sahiwal, Jersy, Brown Swiss, Holstein cattle.

ii. **Draught purpose breeds**: Bullocks are good for draught purpose. Eg. Kangayam, Malvi.

iii. **Dual Purpose breeds**: Cows are meant for yielding more milk and bullocks are used for better drought purpose. Eg. Ongole, Hariana.

Gir Kangeyam

**Figure 13.12 Differ**  

To meet the milk demand of the growing population, milk breeds are preferred by farmers in small scale farms. Goats are also used all over India for supplementing deficiencies in milk production. Some of the breeds of cattle that are good milkers are Jamunapari in Ganga-Jamuna riverine tracts, Beetal in Punjab, Bar–bari in Uttarpradesh.

Vechur breed is the smallest breed of Cow as per World Guinness Records. Average length: 124cms

Average height: 87 cms Origin: Vechur village, Kottayam District of Kerala It produces large amount of milk in relation to the food consumption

India is the largest producer of Milk, globally. India has many popular breeds of cows and buffaloes. **Prominent indigenous cow breeds in India -** Gir, Red sindhi, Sahiwal, Hallikar, Amritmahal, Khillari, Kangayam, Bargur, Umblachery, Pulikulam, Alambadi, Tharparkar, Haryana, Kankrej, Ongole, Krishna valley and Deoni.

**Common diseases of cattle:** A healthy animal eat, drinks and sleeps well regularly. Healthy cattle appear bright, alert and active in their movement with a shiny coat. Cattle are affected by a large number of diseases. Cattle in ill health appear dull, restless and change posture frequently with drop in milk yield. The main diseases of dairy cattle are rinderpest, foot and mouth disease, cow pox, hemorrhagic fever, anthrax.

**Uses of dairy products: Milk products:** Milk is produced by dairy animals which is an emulsion of fat and lactose. Milk also contains enzymes which are destroyed during pasteurization. Milk is a rich source of vitamin A, B1, B2, and deficient in Vitamin C. Due to its high nutrition value, it serves as a complete food for infants. Dairy products such as yoghurt, cheese, butter, ice cream, condensed milk, curd, and milk powder processed from milk make dairy, a highly farming attraction. **Meat:** Meat is rich in protein and also contains many minerals like iron, zinc, vitamins and selenium. It also contains vitamins needed for human diet. **Land management:** Grazing of livestock is sometimes used as a way to control weeds and undergrowth. **Manure:** Manure can be spread on agriculture fields to increase crop yields.

**Poultry Farming** The word poultry refers to the rearing and propagation of avian species such as chicken, ducks, turkeys, geese, quail and guinea fowls. The most common and commercially farmed birds are chicken and ducks. Poultry farming is essential for the purpose of meat, eggs and feather production. Commercial poultry farming is also profitable. In this  

part we are discussing about an overview of the chicken and duck breeds, farming practices and its advantages. **Types of Chicken breeds: There are more** than 100 breeds. The commonly farmed chicken breeds are categorized into five based on the purpose for which it is farmed. They are egg layers, broiler type, dual type, games and ornamental types (Figure 13.13). 1. **Egg layers:** These are farmed mainly

for the production of egg. **Leghorn: This is the most popular**

commercial breed in India and originated from Italy. They are small, compact with a single comb and wattles with white, brown or black colour. They mature early and begin to lay eggs at the age of 5 or 6 months. Hence these are preferred in commercial farms. They can also thrive well in dry areas.

**Chittagong:** It is the breed chiefly found in West Bengal. They are golden or light yellow coloured. The beak is long and yellow in colour. Ear lobes and wattles are small and red in colour. They are good egg layers and are delicious. 2. **Broiler type:** These are well known for

fast growth and soft quality meat. **White Plymouth rock:** They have

white plumage throughout the body. It is commonly used in broiler production. This is an American breed. It is a fast growing breed and well suitable for growing intensively in confined farms. 3. **Dual purpose breeds:** These are for

both meat and egg production purpose. **Brahma:** It is a breed popularly known

for its massive body having heavy bones, well feathered and proportionate body. Pea comb is one of the important breed characters. It has two common varieties namely, Light Brahma and Dark Brahma.




  

4\. **Game breeds:** Since ancient times, special breed of roosters have been used for the sport of cockfighting. **Aseel: This breed is white or black in**

colour. The hens are not good egg layers but are good in incubation of eggs. It is found in all states of India. Aseel is noted for its pugnacity, high stamina, and majestic gait and dogged fighting qualities. Although poor in productivity, this breed is well- known for their meat qualities. 5. **Ornamental breeds:** Ornamental

chicken are reared as pets in addition to their use for egg production and meat. **Silkie**: It is a breed of chicken has a

typical fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk and satin. The breed has numerous additional special characters, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, while the majority chickens only have four. They are exhibited in poultry shows, and come out in various colours. Silkies are well recognized for their calm, friendly temperament. Silkie chicken is especially simple to maintain as pets.

**Types of Poultry farming: There are** different methods used to rear both broiler and layer chicken. The types of poultry farming are Free range farming, Organic method, Yarding method, Battery cage method and Furnished cage method.

**Figure 13.13 Different t**

Among these, Battery cage method is widely used in large scale poultry farms. The Free range, Organic and Yarding methods are eco-friendly and the eggs produced by such farming practices are preferred in the market. **Stages involved in rearing:** There are some steps involved in rearing of chicken. **1\. Selection of the best layer:** An active

intelligent looking bird, with a bright comb, not obese should be selected.

**2\. Selection of eggs for hatching:** Eggs should be selected very carefully. Eggs should be fertile, medium sized, dark brown shelled and freshly laid eggs are preferred for rearing. Eggs should be washed, cleaned and dried.

**3\. Incubation and hatching: The** maintenance of newly laid eggs in optimum condition till hatching is called incubation. The fully developed chick emerges out of egg after an incubation period of 21 – 22 days. There are two types of incubation namely natural incubation and artificial incubation.In the natural incubation method, only a limited number of eggs can be incubated by a mother hen. In artificial incubation, more number of eggs can be incubated in a chamber (**Incubator)**.

**4\. Brooding:** Caring and management of young chicks for 4 – 6 weeks immediately after hatching is called brooding. It can also be categorized into two types namely natural and artificial brooding. **5\. Housing of Poultry:** To protect the poultry from sun, rain and predators it is necessary to provide housing to poultry. Poultry house should be moisture- proof, rat proof and it should be easily cleanable and durable. **6\. Poultry feeding: The diet of chicks** should contain adequate amount of water, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals.

**Poultry products:** The main products of poultry farming are eggs and meat. In India, the primary aim of poultry farming is to obtain eggs. The eggs and poultry meat are the richest sources of proteins and vitamins. **Poultry byproducts:** The feathers of poultry birds are used for making pillows and quilts. Droppings of poultry can be used as manure in fields. The droppings are rich in nitrogen, potash and phosphates.

A number of poultry byproducts like blood-meal, feather meal, poultry by- product meal and hatchery by-product meal are used as good sources of nutrients for meat producing animals and poultry. These byproducts supply proteins, fats, vitamins and good amount of minerals.

**Poultry diseases:** Ranikhet, Coccidiosis, and Fowl pox are some common poultry diseases. **Benefits of Poultry farming:** The advantages of poultry farming are • It does not require high capital for

construction and maintenance of the poultry farming.  

• It does not require a big space. • It ensures high return of investment

within a very short period of time. • It provides fresh and nutritious food

and has a huge global demand. • It provides employment opportunities

for the people.

Chickens communicate with more than 24 vocalizations, each with a distinct meaning, including warning their friends about different types of predators or letting their mothers know whether they’re comfortable

**Duck Farming** Duck is an aquatic bird and forms only 6% of our country’s poultry population. There are about 20 breeds of ducks. The native one includes Indian Runner and Syhlet meta. The exotic breeds include Muscori, Pekin, Aylesbury and Campbell. Domesticated ducks have been derived from the wild duck named Mallard (Anas boscas). Farming ducks is profitable as it can be combined with aquafarming practices. **Peculiarity of ducks:** The body is fully covered with oily feathers. They have a layer of fat under their skin which prevents it from getting wet. They lay eggs at night or in the morning. The ducks feed on rice bran, kitchen wastes, waste fish and snails. **Types of breeds: There are three types of** ducks depending on the purpose for which it is formed. They are meat productive duck breeds, egg productive duck breeds, and breeds for both meat and egg production. **Advantages of duck farming:** They can be reared in small backyards where water is available and needs less care and management as they are very hardy. They can adapt themselves to all types of environmental conditions and are breed for feed efficiency, growth rate and resistance to diseases.




  

**Summary**
 Economic Zoology involves the study

of application of animals for human welfare. The need of Zoology is to improve our economic condition, to provide food security and employment opportunities. Based on the economic importance, animals can be categorized as Animals for food and food products, economically beneficial animals, Animals of aesthetic importance and Animals for scientific research. Vermiculture is the process of using earthworms to decompose organic food waste, into a nutrient-rich material capable of supplying necessary nutrients to sustain plant growth. Sericulture is the production of silk from the silk worm. It is an agro-based industry comprising three main components. They are cultivation of food plants for the silkworms, rearing of silkworms and reeling and spinning of silk. Care and management of honey bees for the production of honey is called Apiculture. Lac is produced by the lac insect.

Aquaponics is a combined technique of aquaculture and hydroponics. It prevents toxic  

water runoff and also maintains ecosystem balance by recycling the waste and excretory products produced by the fish. Aquaculture deals with the farming of aquatic organisms such as fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. On the basis of water resources, aquaculture can be classified into Freshwater aquaculture, brackish water aquaculture and Marine water aquaculture. It includes culture of fishes, prawn, crab and oyster.

Animal husbandry is the practice of breeding and raising livestock cattles like cows, buffaloes, and goats and birds etc. that are useful to human beings. Dairying is the production and marketing of milk and its products. Dairy operation consists of proper maintenance of cattle, collection and processing the milk and its byproducts. Poultry refers to the rearing and propagation of avian species such as chicken, ducks, turkeys, geese, quail and guinea fowls. The commonly farmed chicken breeds are categorized into five based on the purpose for which it is farmed. They are egg layers, broiler type, dual type, games and ornamental types.
