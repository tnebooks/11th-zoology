## Lac Culture
 The culture of lac insect using techniques for the procurement of lac on large scale is known as Lac culture. Lac is produced by the lac insect _Tachardia lacca_ previously known as _Laccifer lacca._ It is a minute, resinous crawling scale insect which inserts its probosics into the plant tissues and sucks juice, grows and secretes lac from the hind end of the body as a protective covering for its body. Moreover the insect is a parasite on host plants i.e., Karanagalli (_Acacia catechu_), Karuvelai (_Acacia nilotica_) and Kumbadiri (_Schleichera oleosa_). The quality of lac depends upon the quality of the host plant. The female lac insect is responsible for large scale production of lac, which is larger than the male lac insect.
