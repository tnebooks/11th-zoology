Animal Tissues## Animal Tissues
 Animal tissues are classified

according to the size, shape and function of the cells. There are four primary (basic) tissue types that interweave to form the ‘fabric’ of the body. They are, the epithelial tissue (covering), the connective tissue (support), the muscle tissue (movement) and the nervous tissue (control) (Figure 3.1).

A reflective layer of tissue called tapetum lucidum, enhances night time vision in

most of the animals like cat.
