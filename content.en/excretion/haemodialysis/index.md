Haemodialysis## Haemodialysis
 Malfunctiong of the kidneys can lead to accumalation of urea and other toxic substances, leading to kidney failure. In such patients toxic urea can be removed from the blood by a process called haemodialysis. A dialyzing machine or an artificial kidney is connected to the patient’s body. A dialyzing machine consists of a long cellulose tube surrounded by the dialysing fluid in a water bath. The patient’s blood is drawn from a conveinent artery and pumped into the dialysing unit after

adding an anticoagulant like heparin. The tiny pores in the dialysis tube allows small molecules such as glucose, salts and urea to enter into the water bath, whereas blood cells and protein molecules do not enter these pores. This stage is similar to the filtration process in the glomerulus. The dialysing liquid in the water bath consists of solution of salt and sugar in correct proportion in order to prevent loss of glucose and essential salts from the blood. The cleared blood is then pumped back to the body through a vein Figure 8.10. **Kidney Transplantation**

It is the ultimate method for correction of acute renal failures. This involves transfer of healthy kidney from one person (donor) to another person with kidney failure. The donated kidney may be taken from a healthy person who is declared brain dead or from sibling or close relatives to minimise the chances of rejection by the immune system of the host. Immunosuppressive drugs are usually administered to the patient to avoid tissue rejection.

The world’s first successful human kidney transplantation was performed from

one twins to antoher by Joseph E. Murray and his colleagues at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, Boston in 1954. The first ever human kidney transplant performed in India was done at the King Edward Memorial Hospital at Mumbai in May 1965, using a cadaver donor in a non-renal failure patient who had had hypernephroma. The first successful live donor kidney transplant in India was done at Christian Medical College Hospital, Vellore in January 1971 by Dr. Johnny and Dr. Mohan Rao.

**Summary**
 Epithelial tissues are the interface between internal fluids and the external environment, creating osmotic barriers in lower organisms. Other specialized epithelial tissues that mediate osmotic and ionic regulation are gills, digestive tract and specialized excretory tissues in different animal groups. Animals remove toxic ammonia to less toxic forms by excretion. Three main strategies of nitrogen excretion are ammonoteles (ammonium), Uricoteles (uric acid) and Ureotelism (Urea). Most aquatic animals are ammonotelic, whereas terrestrial animals are uricotelic (reptiles and birds) or ureoteles (mammals). Urea is produced by the Ornithine cycle/Urea cycle in the liver.

Invertebrates have primitive kidneys such as protonephridia and metanephridia. Water balance in insects is regulated  

by Malphigian tubules. Ion and water regulation in vertebrates are carried out by the kidneys. The functional units of kidney is the nephron. Urine is formed by 3 processes, Glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption and tubular secretion. Filtration occurs at the glomerulus, a ball of capillaries surrounded by the Bowman’s capsule. From the Bowman’s capsule the primary urine enters the proximal tubule, and proceeds to the loop of Henle, with its ascending and descending limbs. The hypertonic fluid then flows to the distal tubule and through the collecting duct into the ureters, the urinary bladder, after a short storage it is sent out of the urethra. Central to the nephron is the counter current system set up between the loop of Henle and the collecting duct along with the capillaries that serve the nephron.

Kidney function is regulated at different levels. GFR is affected by colloidal osmotic pressure and capsular hydrostatic pressure between the glomerulus and Bowman’s capsule, surface area available for filtration are the factors that affect filtration pressure. The kidneys act only on the plasma, yet the extra cellular fluid consists of both plasma and interstitial fluid. The interstitial fluid is the true internal fluid environment of the body. Interstitial fluid is the only component that comes in direct contact with the cells. Thus by performing regulatory and excretory roles on the plasma, the kidneys maintains the proper interstitial fluid environment for optimum cell functioning.

Various hormones control diuresis. Vasopressin alters the permeability of the collecting duct, the renin- angiotensin system, sympathetic system and aldosterone act together to regulate Na1, K1, water and pressure balance.
