# Role of other organs in excretion


Apart from kidneys, organs such as lungs, liver and skin help to remove wastes. Our lungs remove large quantities of carbon dioxide (18 L/day) and significant quantities of water every day. Liver secretes bile containing substances like, bilirubin and biliverdin, cholesterol, steroid hormones, vitamins and drugs which are excreted out along with the digestive wastes.

Sweat and sebaceous glands in the skin eliminate certain wastes through their secretions. Sweat produced by the sweat glands primarily helps to cool the body and secondarily excretes Na1 and Cl2, small quantities of urea and lactate. Sebaceous glands eliminate certain substances like sterols, hydrocarbons and waxes through sebum that provides a protective oily covering for the skin. Small quantities of nitrogenous wastes are also excreted through saliva.
